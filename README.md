# Data_visualzation
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn library to perform data visualization on a dataset. This project discusses all the codes necessary to develop various plots for visual analysis.

### Dataset
Data set to be used:
- Pokemon : This dataset comprise of attributes of creatures in the video game series Pok√©mon.
- Fuel_econ : This data set describes various car attributes, such as fuel efficiency. The cars in this dataset represent about 3900 sedans tested by the EPA from 2013 to 2018.  

### Univariate exploration
Univariate exploration means generation of visuals based on a single variable.
The plots are determined using the data type of the data to be plotted.

* Qualitative data

  - Bar Chart
  - Pie Chart
  - Donut Chart
* Quantitative data
  - Histogram Chart
  
### Bivariate exploration
Bivariate exploration means generation of visuals based on a two variable.
The plots are determined using the data type of the data to be plotted.
* Two Quantitative data
  - Scatter plot
  - Heat map
* Qualitative vs Quantitative data
  - Violin plot
  - Box Plot
  - Faceted Plot
* Two Qualitative data
  - Clustered Bar chart
